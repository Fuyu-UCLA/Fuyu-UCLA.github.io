This is my full code to scrape information of recommended animes which my favorite anime's actors have appeared.
```python
import scrapy

class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "imdb_spider"

    start_urls = ["https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8324154/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2"]

    def parse(self, response):
        """To scrape web site, get base url and find cast crew page.

        Returns:
            Nothing
        """

        # find a url of "cast and crew page"
        cast_crew_page = response.css("div.ipc-title__wrapper a").attrib["href"]

        # connect start_urls and cast_crew_page 
        # to succeed to go to crew and cast page
        cast_crew_page = response.urljoin(cast_crew_page)

        # call "parse_full_credits" with "cast_crew_page" url
        yield scrapy.Request(cast_crew_page, callback=self.parse_full_credits)

    
    def parse_full_credits(self, response):

        # table.cast_list tr tag has actors names so separate them by for loop
        for cast in response.css("table.cast_list tr"):

            # call "a" tag here
            cast_page = cast.css("a")

            # if there is no page on the tag, skip and go next
            if (cast_page):
                cast_page = response.urljoin(cast_page.attrib["href"])

                yield scrapy.Request(cast_page, callback=self.parse_actor_page)

    
    def parse_actor_page(self, response):
        """To scrape casts page's information, find actor's name and get 
            info of TV and movie names the actor has appeared

            response : having access to url in cast_page which is

            Nothing
        """

        # to get actor's name
        actor_name = response.css(
            "div.name-overview-widget tr h1.header span.itemprop::text").get()

        if (not actor_name):
            # actor_page of actor who does not have picture on profile has 
            # a little bit different html code so write a code to get no-pic actor's name
            actor_name = response.css(
                "div.no-pic-wrapper h1.header span.itemprop::text").get()

        # separate movie and TV name list with for loop then get text movie and TV names
        for movie_TV in response.css("div.filmo-category-section div"):
            movie_or_TV_name = movie_TV.css("b a::text").get()
            # check if there is "movie_or_TV_name"
            if (movie_or_TV_name):
                # make dict with yield
                yield {
                    "actor" : actor_name, 
                    "movie_or_TV_name" : movie_or_TV_name
                    }
```

In this program, there are 3 main parts of definition.

Here’s how we set up the first one named parse
```python
def parse(self, response):
        """To scrape web site, get base url and find cast crew page.

        Args:
            self     : point own class "imdbSpider"
            response : having access to start_urls

        Returns:
            Nothing
        """

        # find a url of "cast and crew page"
        cast_crew_page = response.css("div.ipc-title__wrapper a").attrib["href"]

        # connect start_urls and cast_crew_page 
        # to succeed to go to crew and cast page
        cast_crew_page = response.urljoin(cast_crew_page)

        # call "parse_full_credits" with "cast_crew_page" url
        yield scrapy.Request(cast_crew_page, callback=self.parse_full_credits)
```
This method works by finding a cast and crew page from a first page of my favorite anime.
"response" gets a start_url which has main page of my favorite anime then try to find a HTML code to go to the next page I would like to go; Full Cast & Crew page by doing like below
![image-example.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/pic16B-HW2-pic1.png) 

after finding HTML code, add it into cast_crew_page and change base url in response by calling .urljoin. Then yield scrapy.Request to call "parse_full_credits" with a new url to go to the Cast & Crew page found in this definition.

Here’s how we set up the second definition named parse_full_credits
```python
def parse_full_credits(self, response):
        """To scrape web's all casts page's information, 
            get url to go all casts pages with using for loop

        Args:
            self     : point own class "imdbSpider"
            response : having access to url in cast_crew_page which is defined in parse

        Returns:
            Nothing
        """
        
        # table.cast_list tr tag has actors names so separate them by for loop
        for cast in response.css("table.cast_list tr"):

            # call "a" tag here
            cast_page = cast.css("a")

            # if there is no page on the tag, skip and go next
            if (cast_page):
                cast_page = response.urljoin(cast_page.attrib["href"])

                # call "parse_actor_page" with "cast_page" which is 
                yield scrapy.Request(cast_page, callback=self.parse_actor_page)
```
this definition gets url of All Cast & Crew page from parse and try to find all casts' individual pages' url by using for loop. 
![image-example.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/pic16B-HW2-pic2.png) 
All casts' pages are in a <table class="cast_list"> ⇨ <tbody> ⇨ <tr> then the loop is running using values in "table.cast_list tr". Each loop(cast) has a link to all cast members' personal introduction pages, one by one. Then also geos into "a" tag. 
if(cast_page) checks if there exist the actor's pagel. If exists, using .urljoin and make a new url to go to the Cast's 


Last one is a parse_actor_page.
```python
def parse_actor_page(self, response):
        """To scrape casts page's information, find actor's name and get 
            info of TV and movie names the actor has appeared

        Args:
            self     : point own class "imdbSpider"
            response : having access to url in cast_page which is 
                       defined in parse_full_credits

        Returns:
            Nothing
        """

        # to get actor's name
        actor_name = response.css(
            "div.name-overview-widget tr h1.header span.itemprop::text").get()

        if (not actor_name):
            # actor_page of actor who does not have picture on profile has 
            # a little bit different html code so write a code to get no-pic actor's name
            actor_name = response.css(
                "div.no-pic-wrapper h1.header span.itemprop::text").get()

        # separate movie and TV name list with for loop then get text movie and TV names
        for movie_TV in response.css("div.filmo-category-section div"):
            movie_or_TV_name = movie_TV.css("b a::text").get()
            # check if there is "movie_or_TV_name"
            if (movie_or_TV_name):
                # make dict with yield
                yield {
                    "actor" : actor_name, 
                    "movie_or_TV_name" : movie_or_TV_name
                    }
```
This definition gets the each casts' pages then get a list of names of the other animes the same cast have appeared by the same way of "parse_full_credits". First, find HTML code of actor name
![image-example.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/pic16B-HW2-pic3.png)

```python
if (not actor_name):
            # actor_page of actor who does not have picture on profile has 
            # a little bit different html code so write a code to get no-pic actor's name
            actor_name = response.css("div.no-pic-wrapper h1.header span.itemprop::text").get()
```
This if function is to find name of some actor. Page of some actors who do not put their picture on this site has different HTML codes, 
![image-example.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/pic16B-HW2-pic4.png)
so if the first code cannot find actor's name, try the other methods above.

Then, go to get movie and TV names with this code by using for loop doing the simlar code as "parse_full_credits"
![image-example.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/pic16B-HW2-pic5.png)
```python
# separate movie and TV name list with for loop then get text movie and TV names
        for movie_TV in response.css("div.filmo-category-section div"):
            movie_or_TV_name = movie_TV.css("b a::text").get()
            # check if there is "movie_or_TV_name"
            if (movie_or_TV_name):
                # make dict with yield
                yield {
                    "actor" : actor_name, 
                    "movie_or_TV_name" : movie_or_TV_name
                    }
```

The scrape code is now complete.

Finaly, run this code to scrape.
```
scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o results.csv
```

Using pandas, put the data from results.csv in results, then rename it to a dataset with only "movie_or_TV_name", and rename the dataset to "movie" using the .rename function. Create a new dataset with the number of movies counted and sorted by number by using the .value_contents function, and rename it to "number of shared actors".
Finally, output the names of the top 10 animations and that's it.
```python
import pandas as pd

results = pd.read_csv("results.csv")
cols = ["movie_or_TV_name"]
results = results[cols].rename(columns={"movie_or_TV_name": "movie"})
results = results.value_counts()
results
df = pd.DataFrame(results, columns=["number of shared actors"])
df.head(10)
```
